# **Epigenomics**
In the wiki section of this repository, I present my answers for [Task 4](https://github.com/bborsari/epigenomics_uvic/wiki/4.-EN%E2%80%90TEx-ATAC%E2%80%90seq-data:-downstream-analyses) and [task 5](https://github.com/bborsari/epigenomics_uvic/wiki/5.-Distal-regulatory-activity) of the course Epigenomics Part I (UVic), which was lectured by Professors Dr. Borsari and Dr. Garrido-Martín.
